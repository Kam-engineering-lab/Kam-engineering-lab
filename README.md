## Hi there 👋 I’m Kam

Ex-investment banker → software engineer in payments.

I started in Mechanical Engineering, explored sales and trading, then found my home building software. These days I ship frontend features, mentor graduate engineers, and ask questions like “does this help the customer’s needs?” or “can I show you an alternative that might suit your needs?”

🔭 Working on: payments & commercial banking platforms  
🌱 Learning: better system design (technical + human)  
🧠 How I learn: by doing and visualising (sketches and prototypes)    
👯 Open to: fun engineering challenges    
💬 Ask me about: career pivots, FX, payments, web engineering, accessibility  
⚡ Fun fact: I’ve gone from pitching to CFOs and trading floors to production releases, and I still enjoy both
